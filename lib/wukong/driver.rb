  # A Driver is a class including the DriverMethods module which
  # connects a Dataflow or Processor to the external world of inputs
  # and outputs.
  #
  # @example Minimal Driver class
  #
  #   class MinimalDriver
  #     include Wukong::DriverMethods
  #     def initialize(label, settings)
  #       construct_dataflow(label, settings)
  #     end
  #     def process record
  #       puts record
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The MinimalDriver#send_through_dataflow method can be called on an
  # instance of MinimalDriver with any input record.
  #
  # This record will be passed through the dataflow, starting from its
  # root, and each record yielded at the leaves of the dataflow will
  # be passed to the driver's #process method.
  #
  # The #process method of an implementing driver should *not* yield,
  # unlike the process method of a Processor class.  Instead, it
  # should treat its argument as an output of the dataflow and do
  # something appropriate to the driver (write to file, database,
  # terminal, &c.).
  #
  # Drivers are also responsible for implementing the lifecycle of
  # processors and dataflows they drive.  A more complete version of
  # the above driver class would:
  #
  #   * call the #setup_dataflow method when ready to trigger the
  #     Processor#setup method on each processor in the dataflow
  #
  #   * call the #finalize_dataflow method when indicating that the
  #     dataflow should consider a batch of records complete
  #
  #   * call the #finalize_and_stop_dataflow method to indicate the
  #     last batch of records and to trigger the Processor#stop method
  #     on each processor in the dataflow
  #
  # Driver instances are started by Runners which should delegate to
  # the `start` method driver class itself.
  #
  # @see Wukong::Local::StdioDriver for a complete example of a driver.
  # @see Wukong::Local::Runner for an example of how runners call drivers.
